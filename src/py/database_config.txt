This file described the different maps that need to added for the twt_bot to
work.

There will be multiple adapters written.

1st will be the deta space adapter.


The maps:
- user_name to user_id (user_name_map)
  This is the map from the twitter user handle (user_name) to the twitter
  user_id is maintained.

- (user_id,list_name) to list_id (list_name_map)
  This needs a composite key because list_names aren't unique across twitter.
  The individual dbs can implement them how ever they want.

- list_id to user_id (list_membership_map)
